 * URLChain class, but setting the prototype internally seemed
 * to be considerably easier at the time of writing this.

 * I've been having this ongoing (randomly occuring) issue where the iframe's will not load until the page has been refreshed.

 * My short term solution is to automatically refresh the iframe when the page loads, so even if the iframe does not load on the 
 * iniitial load it does not matter.
 * Not the niceset fix, but it'll do for now ;)
